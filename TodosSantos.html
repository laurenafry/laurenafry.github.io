         I have been absoultely blessed with the opportunity to study abroad for my final semester of <br /> 
	my undergraduate degree at CSU in sunny beautiful Mexico! CSU has a center here in Todos Santos BCS <br />
	where I am staying with the 9 other students. However, we have fieldtrips and camping trips <br />
	to explore the entire region of Baja California Sur. We are just about to round out the first week <br />
	of our shortened 10week semester, with some pink faces, misquito bitten limbs, but huge smiles all around. </p>

        Nestled in the rolling hills and borderd by the beach on one side and the <br />
	Sierra la Laguna Mountains on the other, the center has views for everyone. <br />

       <p style="font-size 14px; font-weight: normal">
	The Highlight of the Trip so Far was definetly the sea turtle hatchling release. We went to Asupmatoma in <br />
	Cabo San Lucas where we dug up hatching nests to collect the Olive Ridley turtles, and release them all at <br />
	sunset. We were completely alone on the beach with nothing but the waves and the hatchlings. It was an <br /> 
	indescribable experience. A bonfire and s'mores rounded out the night. The early morning brought another hatching nest  
	of turtles to release at sunrise.

       <p style="font-size 16px; font-weight: normal">
        There are 7 Species of Sea Turtles, and all of them are Endangered. Humans have pushed a steady population <br />
	over the edge towards extinction. Without change we will lose these beautiful animals that are such an <br /> 
	important link in many ecosystems. Turtles and Eggs are poached for meat, skin, and shells. As well as facing<br />
	 habitat destruction, bycatch, and climate change. A change in temperature of their nesting site, alters the sex <br />
	of the hatchlings, with extreme enough conditions favoring one sex the species is doomed.

       <p style="font-size 14px; font-weight: normal">
	We have visited Los Cerritos, a famous surf beach, a few times now. I could spend days exploring all of <br />
	the tide pools, they all have something new each visit. When it gets too hot, the chilly salty mist from <br /> 
	the waves crashing against the rocks is there to cool you off.

         Cabo Pulmo is the only hard coral reef in the Gulf of California, and it is also a National Park. <br />
	Cabo Pulmo is the most productive, biodiverse reef that I have ever had the opportunity to snorkel. <br />
	The local fisherman would bring in less and less fish, so they decided to make a change. <br /> 
	A few of the locals got together and would patrol the waters, waiting for the area to become an <br />
	official marine protected area. They had only self imposed rules and regulations, and their <br />
	enforment was up to them.
