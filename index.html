         I know what you are thinking and No, this isint edited! The trees at Horsetooth Reservoir are abolutely electric this time of year <br/>I was supposed to be fishing for crayfish for a class of mine, but the only thing I caught today was a possible cold!

          Northern Colorado is well known for the beautiful Poudre River and its network of trails. <br/>It is a popular spot for college kids (like myself) to float down the river in inner tubes. </br>I snapped this while finding a spot to fish the river, I didn't see any trout but I did see bear tracks!

         I am on the CSU JV Polo team. <br/>This photo was taken during a weekend tournament againt the Denver Polo Club which included professional players, the pony I am on is the sweetheart Negrita. <br/>If you haven't seen polo played I highly suggest checking it out, arena polo is a very exciting fast paced, high contact game of polo.
