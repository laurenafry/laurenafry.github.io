          Northern Colorado is well known for the beautiful Poudre River and its network of trails. <br />
	It is a popular spot for college kids (like myself) to float down the river in inner tubes. <br />
	I snapped this while finding a spot to fish the river, I didn't see any trout but I did see bear tracks!
