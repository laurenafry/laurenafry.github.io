I recently studied abroad in Todos Santos, BCS Mexico at the Colorado State University Campus located there! It was an amazing experience, we traveled all around the Baja, from the Sea of Cortez to the Pacific Ocean with Todos Santos Eco Adventures (TOSEA). Our guides have formal training as biologists and are so knowledgeable about all the local flora and fauna, plus they are great fun and company. We quickly became just a large group of friends traveling and learning together.

Another well-kept secret of CSU is the Mountain Campus, previously known as Pingree Park Campus. Up in the mountains just north of Rocky Mountain National Park, nestled in a valley at the base of many peaks including Comanche and the Stormy Peaks, Mummy Pass, and so many more. Through the center of the valley and the campus is the South Fork of the Cache la Poudre River, surrounded by willows it is a huge draw to the local moose population.

While some may not think of December as an ideal time to visit Scotland, the forecast couldn't scare off my mother and I. Colorado had trained us well, outfitted for the worst, the two of us packed up for 10 days of Scottish winter. We were very pleasantly surprised to not need any of our winter gear, as the weather was fantastic, a chill of fall in the air and only a single day of rain, all we needed was a light jacket and a soft sweater.

I had the amazing opportunity to travel all around the four corners region of America for a week visiting National Parks with EcoFlight in their Flight Across America student program. During the trip we flew over so many national monuments and parks I can hardly keep track. Some of the parks we spent time in were Arches, Grand Canyon, and Mesa Verde National Parks. This photo was taken of me in Grand Canyon National Park.

         My dog Bandit, is a Blue Heeler/German Shorthaired Pointer mix and is almost five years old now! I love getting out to hike with Bandit every chance I get, he is a fantastic adventure buddy.
